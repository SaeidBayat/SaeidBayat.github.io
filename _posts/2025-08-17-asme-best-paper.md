I am excited to share that our team — <strong>Vishnu Vijayasankar</strong>, <strong>Saeid Bayat</strong>, and <strong>Prof. Lei Zuo</strong> — received <strong>First Place Best Student Paper Award</strong> at the ASME IDETC 2025 Vibration Conference. Our paper, titled <i>“Development of a Scaled Hydrofoil-Based Marine Energy Converter: Design, Modeling, and Parametric Optimization”</i>, was recognized for both its technical innovation and its contribution to the future of marine renewable energy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This work focused on designing and optimizing a scaled hydrofoil-based marine energy converter capable of harvesting energy from wave-induced oscillatory flows. By combining hydrodynamic modeling, structural dynamics, power take-off optimization, and control-informed design, we developed a platform that demonstrates the feasibility of efficient hydrofoil-based energy extraction. The project represents a meaningful step toward practical, sustainable marine energy systems.

Receiving this recognition from ASME is deeply rewarding. It highlights the strengths of our collaborative work at the University of Michigan and reinforces the importance of innovative renewable energy research. I am grateful for the teamwork, mentorship, and support that made this achievement possible.
