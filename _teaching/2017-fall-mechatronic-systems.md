### Role

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Served as a teaching assistant for the undergraduate Mechatronic Systems course during Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. The course introduced students to microcontroller-based system design, actuator and sensor integration, real-time control, and the fundamentals of building electromechanical systems. I assisted students through weekly labs and design projects that required embedded programming, circuit development, and system-level implementation.

### Responsibilities

- Guided students in laboratory sessions covering sensor interfacing, actuator control, and real-time microcontroller programming.
- Assisted with debugging hardware and software issues, including circuit wiring, signal conditioning, and C/C++ firmware implementation.
- Supported student teams developing semester-long mechatronic design projects such as robotic arms, mobile robots, and autonomous mechanisms.
- Evaluated lab reports, coding assignments, and project milestones for functionality, documentation quality, and design rigor.
- Held office hours to help students with embedded programming, control implementation, and system integration challenges.

### Topics and Skills Supported

- Microcontroller programming in C/C++  
- Sensor integration (encoders, ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, accelerometers)  
- Actuator control using DC motors, servos, and stepper motors  
- Basic signal conditioning and circuit interfacing  
- Real-time control implementation and tuning  
- Mechatronic system design and prototyping  
- Documentation and project-based learning practices
