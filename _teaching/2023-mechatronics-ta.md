### Role

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Served as the teaching assistant for SE 423 – Introduction to Mechatronics, an undergraduate course integrating embedded programming, sensing, actuation, and closed-loop control. The course centers on hands-on learning using the TI LaunchXL-F28379D microcontroller platform, real-time C programming, and system-level mechatronic design through structured labs and a semester-long robotics project.

### Responsibilities

- Supported weekly lab sessions by helping students with hardware–software integration, including sensor interfacing, PWM motor control, ADC/DAC usage, and interrupt-based embedded programming.
- Assisted students with debugging issues in Code Composer Studio, troubleshooting wiring and circuit problems, validating signal acquisition, and interpreting real-time system behavior.
- Guided student teams through incremental project milestones, helping them implement locomotion control, sensor fusion, and navigation logic for autonomous mobile robot projects.
- Held office hours to provide individualized support in embedded C programming, microcontroller configuration, and control design for electromechanical systems.
- Evaluated lab check-offs, homework, and project deliverables, ensuring technical correctness and clear documentation.
- Helped coordinate lab logistics, maintain equipment, and prepare demonstration setups.

### Topics and Skills Supported

- Digital I/O, timers, interrupts, ADC/DAC, PWM generation, and serial communication (UART, SPI, I²C).
- Integration of sensors such as encoders, IMUs, IR distance sensors, ultrasonic devices, and gyroscopes.
- Motor control using H-bridge drivers, closed-loop speed and position control, and real-time feedback.
- Embedded C programming on TI microcontrollers with an emphasis on deterministic timing.
- Signal processing for mechatronics applications, including filtering and noise mitigation.
- Robot navigation fundamentals and implementation of control algorithms for mobile platforms.
