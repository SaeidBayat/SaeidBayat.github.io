I am Saeid Bayat, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, working under the supervision of Prof. Lei Zuo. My research focuses on Control Co-Design (CCD), floating offshore wind turbines, and wave energy converters. I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. James Allison, where I worked on multidisciplinary design optimization and control of complex engineering systems.

My work spans control co-design, optimization, optimal control, model predictive control, simulation-based design optimization, floating offshore wind turbines, and wave energy conversion systems. I enjoy developing computational tools and frameworks to address real-world challenges in renewable energy and marine systems.

Here is my [CV](https://saeidbayat.com/cv) and feel free to [contact me](mailto:saeidb@umich.edu) for collaboration or opportunities.
