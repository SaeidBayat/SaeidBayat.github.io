I am Saeid Bayat, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. My work focuses on Control Co-Design (CCD), floating offshore wind turbines, and renewable energy systems. I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by Professor James Allison and worked on multidisciplinary design optimization and control of complex mechanical systems.

My research combines theory and application across a range of disciplines including control systems, hydrodynamics, biomechanics, and robotics. I enjoy developing computational tools and simulation frameworks to address real-world engineering challenges.

Here is my [CV](https://saeidbayat.com/cv) and feel free to [contact me](mailto:saeidb@umich.edu) for collaboration or opportunities.
